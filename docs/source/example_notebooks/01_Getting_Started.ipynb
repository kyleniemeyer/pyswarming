    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your knowledge of Python and swarm behaviors, you can take two approaches to using PySwarming:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple and low-code simulations**: start using the PySwarming.Swarm class, which allows the creation of virtual swarms to be used with\n",
    "some behaviors functions.\n",
    "2. **Custom animated simulations**: here you are able to use all the available behaviors, however, you will need to code a little bit more, i.e., the creation of the swarm, the animation, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you have examples of each approach mentioned above. For more examples, you can see the [notebooks](https://github.com/mrsonandrade/pyswarming/tree/main/notebooks) and [examples](https://github.com/mrsonandrade/pyswarming/tree/main/examples) directories of PySwarming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## (Approach 1) Low-code: PySwarming.Swarm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Beginners**: If you're already familiar with Python and swarm behaviors, you can see a more customized example [here](#approach-2-gentler-introduction-to-custom-animations).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulating repulsion behavior among the swarm\n",
    "The idea of this simulation is to use the low-code tool from PySwarming, which enables us to carry out simplified animations with some behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we need to set some parameters to create our swarm, such as the number of robots, the linear speed of the robots, and so on.\n",
    "After that, we simply call `simulate()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For details, see the code below."
